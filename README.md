# codsoft

A new Flutter project.

## Tasks

This project contains multiple tasks assigned to me by CodSoft which are:
1. ToDO App
2. Expense Tracker
3. Music Player 

## Features 

I got to learn about various concepts while working on this tasks including:
1. Widget Hierarchy
2. Responsive UI
3. Bloc State Management
4. CRUD operation using Hive Database

The lib folder contains all the three tasks and you can run each individual task on you emulator separately.
